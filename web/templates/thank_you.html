<p>This tool was built on February 2018 by <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/visaub'>the IT Department</a> of Forum ETSEIB in order to make easier the control of assistance to activities.</p>
<p>It could not have been completed without the guide, help and support of SOS ETSEIB.
Thanks to the code of their web, <a href='https://sosetseib.upc.edu'>sosetseib.upc.edu</a>, we were able to deploy features much faster, specially on
log-in and database management. They also provided continous feedback that pushed this little project forward.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank HackUPC, for their <a href='https://my.hackupc.com/'>HackAssistant</a>, from which their user interface,
search tables and QR scanner are taken and adapted to our needs.</p>
